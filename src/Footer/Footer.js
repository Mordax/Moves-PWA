          <h4>Our Mission</h4>
          <p>
            Our help is <b>free and confidential</b> and be open from the
            beginning of 2020, from there we will always be open to our
            volunteers' calls or emails if they or anyone they know requires
            help. We therefore aspire to offer this service by sponsorships and
            hope to receive widespread support of our work to build a stronger
            civil community - not only in Tanger, but the rest of Morocco- with
            the help of the local, national and international associations.
